# Instance-Segmentation
# Step 1:
run this command:
git clone https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git
Follow the steps mentioned in the README.md of Mask_RCNN
Note: For me Tensorflow==1.6.0, Keras==2.2.5 versions worked.
# Step 2:
Inside the folder called samples create a new folder call it "Nucleus_Seg".
# Step 3:
Download the dataset from the link:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/
Save the dataset inside a folder call it Dataset inside Nucleus_Seg.
# Step 4:
Copy all the files provided in this repository to Nucleus_Seg.
# Note:
You will find the file .h5 of the weights on the google drive of this project.
